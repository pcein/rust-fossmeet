# Why is Rust so exciting?

- Safe low-level systems programming

- Memory safety without garbage collection

- High-level abstractions (influenced by statically typed
  functional programming languages like ML)  without run-time overhead

- Concurrency without data races

# Why not just use C/C++?

> How can I avoid being burned by Câ€™s numerous and 
> severe shortcomings? This is a development environment 
> where only the paranoid can survive.

# A bit of Rust history

- Started by Graydon Hoare as a personal project in 2006

- Mozilla foundation started sponsoring Rust in 2010

- Rust 1.0 released in May, 2015

- Regular six week release cycles

# Core language features

- Memory safety without garbage collection
   
    * Ownership
    * Move Semantics
    * Borrowing and lifetimes

- Type Inference
- Algebraic Data Types (Sum and Product types)
- Exhaustive Pattern Matching
- Trait-based generics
- Iterators
- Zero Cost Abstractions
- Concurrency without data races
- Efficient C bindings, minimal runtime

# Structure of this workshop

- Understanding the problems with C/C++
- Understanding Ownership, Borrow, Move semantics and Lifetimes
- Other features (depending on availability of time)


# The Stack

```c
// a0.c

int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    return 0;
}
```

# Buffer overflow


```c
// a1.c
int main()
{
    int i=1;
    int a[4];
    int j=2;

    a[4] = 5; // bug
    a[5] = 6; // bug
    a[10000] = 7; // bug
}
```

# Pointers in C

```c
// a2.c
int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    int *b;
    
    b = &a;
    *b = 20;
}
```

# Stack Frames - deallocations and allocations

```c
// a3.c
void fun2() { int e=5, f=6; }
void fun1() { int c=3, d=4; }

int main()
{
    int a=1, b=2;
    fun1(); fun2();
    return 0;
}
```

# Dangling Pointers

```c
// a4.c
void fun2() { int m = 1; int n = 2; }
int* fun1() { 
    int *p; int q = 0;
    p = &q; return p; // bug
}

int main() {
    int *a, b; a = fun1();
    *a = 10; fun2();
    b = *a;
}
```
